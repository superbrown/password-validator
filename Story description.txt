Write a password validation service, meant to be configurable via IoC (using dependency injection engine of your choice).
The service is meant to check a text string for compliance to any number of password validation rules.
The rules currently known are:

1. Must consist of a mixture of lowercase letters and numerical digits only, with at least one of each.
2. Must be between 5 and 12 characters in length.
3. Must not contain any sequence of characters immediately followed by the same sequence.
4. The password may not be the same as any of the users three most recent passwords.

The project should include a build capability in one of the following tools, Eclipse, IntelliJ, ant, or maven.

The project should be ready for insertion into a production system.

Show tests for the validator service and any constituent classes involved in fulfillment of the service.

Also, show how to access and use the validator service at runtime
